Oliver's recent data mining projects are mainly coded in python, they show a range of data analysis skills and statistical knowledge.<br/>
Each branch showcases a different project and a variety of usefull skills, a bit like a portfolio to be read along with Oliver's CV.<br/>
Of particular interest are Oliver's CNN/AI project in which a convolutional neural network is designed and trained to classify images of food,<br/>
