# CNN for food classification
Oliver's recent data mining projects are mainly coded in python, they show a range of data analysis skills and statistical knowledge.<br/>
Each repo showcases a different project and a variety of usefull skills, a bit like a portfolio to be read along with Oliver's CV.<br/>
Of particular interest is Oliver's CNN/AI project in which a convolutional neural network is designed and trained to classify images of food,<br/>

<br/> this notebook (.ipynb) was developed from Oliver's Master's project in Big Data.
<br/><br/>Please take a look!  

### Abstract 
This CNN project sees 3 artificial neural network models built from scratch using keras with tensorflow to build sequential models of different architechtural designs.
The different layers, shapes, and structure of each network produce varying results in their abilities to identify the images of food from the training dataset.
