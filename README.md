Oliver's recent data mining projects are mainly coded in python, they show a range of data analysis skills and statistical knowledge.<br/>
Each branch showcases a different project and a variety of usefull skills, a bit like a portfolio to be read along with Oliver's CV.<br/>
Of particular interest is Oliver's CNN/AI project in which a convolutional neural network is designed and trained to classify images of food,<br/>

<br/>and a statistical worksheet displaying analytical and statistical knowledge/skills to do with grouping and data privacy.
<br/><br/>Please take a look at each branch!
