# CNN for food classification
Oliver's recent data mining projects are mainly coded in python, they show a range of data analysis skills and statistical knowledge.<br/>
Each repo showcases a different project and a variety of usefull skills, a bit like a portfolio to be read along with Oliver's CV.<br/>
Of particular interest is Oliver's CNN/AI project in which a convolutional neural network is designed and trained to classify images of food,<br/>

<br/> this notebook (.ipynb) was developed from Oliver's Master's project in Big Data.
<br/><br/>Please take a look!
